## About

Tha website is the task from Software Engineering Bootcamp.
<br>
The requirements were to create practical web application.
<br>The app has Homepage, where as, the user can look for different kinds of plants.
<br>A page where you can view your saved plants.
<br>Page where you can search for plants example(Fern)
<br>A page where you can leave a comment.

The main tasks:

1. Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).
2. Use Promises and async/await, where appropriate.
3. Use Axios or fetch to retrieve data from an API.
4. Use MongoDB to create a database for your application.
5. Create reasonable schemas for your data by following data modeling best practices.
6.Include API routes for all four CRUD operations.
7.Use React to create the applicationâ€™s front-end.
8.Create at least four different views or pages for the application.
9.Create a short overview of your application.
10.Discuss additional features that could be added to the application in the future.

## Technologies

Create a full-stack web application
- MonogoDB
- Express
- React
- Node
- (MERN) Stack

## Future app possibilities

There are possibilities to expand app for more features like:

1. Making it more interactive for the users. adding a comment box or a place where you can buy the plants you see.
2. Have one or more complex user interface modules such as a carousel, drag and drop, a sticky nav, tooltips, etc.
3. Change single-page webiste to be more complex, many different routes.
4. I would like to have the pictures of each plant over and display the info about each plant on the back of a "card".
5. Look into localstorage so you can save data to the user's browser.
